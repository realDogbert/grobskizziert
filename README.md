# Grobskizziert Help

This is a custom theme for Ghost (https://en.ghost.org).
It is based on the original theme https://github.com/starburst1977/Readium. Thanks to starburst1977.

1. Copy the contents of the .zip file into /content/themes/. 

2. You need to restart your Ghost instance. After that you can switch themes inside your Ghost admin (http://your.domain.com/ghost/settings/general/). Scroll down and choose "Readium".

3. Now you can customize your logo, langing page image, as well as user images and texts to fit the theme.

4. Have fun.
